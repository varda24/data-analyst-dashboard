# TODO List for Fixing Overlapping in Boxplots and Summary

- [x] Modify Charts.tsx to arrange boxplots in a grid layout (4-5 per row) and reposition labels to prevent overlap
- [x] Update Statistics.tsx to improve the display of column details in the table to avoid overflow
- [x] Test the UI changes to ensure no overlapping and proper layout (dev server running at http://localhost:5173/)
